# Delay-Prediction-
Simple Machine Learning Model that predicts whether the flight is delayed 


## Project Description 
This project features a simple machine learning model that predicts whether the flight is delayed or not. Decision Tree is used for prediction. Features are converted into numbers so it would be better for classification. The model should be updated to have a decision tree built from scratch.
